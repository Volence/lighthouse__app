# lighthouse__app
A little app to run audits on a site and present them to a front end

Contains a backend made with node, graphql, express, and some leftover restful junk (that was used before graphql).
Also contains a frontend made with react, victorygraph, and apollo client

You can find the most up to date version (usually) [here](https://volence.dev/lighthouse_app/)
